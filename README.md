# Python Concepts Demonstration

This repository contains Python programs demonstrating various fundamental concepts. Each topic listed below is implemented with simple Python code examples. These exercises were given as an assessment by **JALA Academy**.

## Topics Covered

- **Python Basics** - Introduction to Python syntax, variables, and data types.
- **Operators** - Arithmetic, logical, comparison, and bitwise operators.
- **Loops** - Demonstration of for and while loops.
- **Arrays** - Basic operations on arrays using lists.
- **Static** - Implementation of static variables and methods.
- **Strings** - String manipulation without inbuilt functions.
- **Inheritance** - Single and multilevel inheritance.
- **Access Modifiers** - Private, protected, and public access specifiers.
- **Abstract Class** - Creating and implementing abstract classes.
- **Packages** - Organizing Python modules into packages.
- **Files** - File handling (read, write, append, random access, permissions).
- **Constructors** - Different types of constructors in Python.
- **Method Overloading** - Demonstration of method overloading.
- **Exceptions** - Exception handling using try-except blocks.
- **Dictionary** - Operations like adding, updating, deleting, and nesting dictionaries.

## Structure

Each topic has a corresponding Python file that contains a simple demonstration of the concept.

The repository is structured to help beginners understand Python programming concepts in a step-by-step manner.
